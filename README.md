# study-buddy
Cute study buddy that helps you study with the Pomodoro (or Animedoro) technique!

## Kirby
The Kirby folder has a Kirby, pink-themed Pomodoro timer

### How to use
1. Clone the GitHub repo or download the ZIP 
2. If you'd like edit `WORK_MIN`, `SHORT_BREAK_MIN`, or `LONG_BREAK_MIN` in `main.py`
3. Run `main.py` from kirby folder and work along with your study buddy! 

## Animedoro
Inspired by Josh Chen's [Animedoro technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUjGZJIgse0&t=117s&ab_channel=JoshChen), I decided to add an Animedoro timer, which helps you to study/work and take breaks for anime episodes. Currently, I have Pain's "Almighty Push" quote as the sound that plays before you work and Erwin Smith's "Shinzou wo Sasageyo!" quote before you watch anime ðŸ˜Ž

### How to use
1. Clone the GitHub repo or download the ZIP 
2. Run `anime.py` from animedoro folder and work along with your study buddy!
3. If you finish working before 60 minutes (and if you've worked at least 40 minutes), then you can click "Next" to go onto your Anime break.
